	<h3>“Remember when we thought the next horizon of feminism was
going to be wage equality or universal health care? Turns out, it’s
underpants.” <a href="#Zeisler" onclick="openBar()" style="color:black; text-decoration: none;"> Andi Zeisler (2016)</a>
	</h3><br>
	<p>In this thesis I am researching the concept of #femvertising. According to the advertising industry, femvertising is a form of advertising that employs pro-female talent, messages, and imagery to empower women and girls. With this type of advertising, I have been confronted with since I was a 12-year-old girl who was learning from media, like tv and the internet, what it means to be a woman. Where I was first mesmerized by this femvertising, I started to grow an annoyance and anger towards femvertisments. However, I didn’t completely understand why. Learning from writers like Sara Ahmed, Simone de Beauvoir, Guy Debord, Betty Friedan, Roxane Gay, Jean Kilbourne, Naomi Klein, Katie Martell, Caroline Criado Perez and Andi Zeisler. But also, by looking at different types of femvertisments over the years and looking at designers harnessing political topics like feminism in their works. I concluded that most companies, that are aligning themselves with feminism through advertising, aren’t practising what they preach. They are merely using feminism this to appeal more to a demographic of female consumers. Which leads towards stylistic, aesthetic and empty representations of feminism known as: Marketplace feminism. The biggest danger of Marketplace feminism is that people might subconsciously start to think that things have already improved, and we no longer need feminism. However, numbers are show there is still a very long way to go. By redefining Femvertising, I want to put more emphasis on the fact the goal of advertising is always to sell a product. Femvertising is a form of advertising that is taking advantage of feminist imagery and ideas, to sell products and change consumers’ brand perspective. 
	<br><br>Unexpectedly, through researching this topic I understand better what feminism means to me and how as a graphic designer I want to apply it in my work.

	<h2 class="title" id="Foreword">FOREWORD <hr></h2>
	<p>Starting this thesis, I would like to give some context to who I am. Normally this would not necessarily be required. But I have learned that the political is always personal, so I think my thesis needs this context. I am a 25-year-old white female, who studies at an art academy in The Netherlands. I am an Intersectional feminist and I am aware that there are different forms of feminisms. Whilst I believe they are all working towards the same goal: equal rights for womxn. How we accomplish this and what this exactly entails (equality and womxn) will be different for many individuals.<br><br>
	In this text certain aspects and perspectives will be more present than others. Since they are better available to me. I have been aware of this and tried to let as many different voices influence me, but this thesis is written in my world. I understand that I cannot write or speak for the experiences of black people, people of color, non-binary people, disabled people or Trans-people. I admire <a href="#Ahmed" onclick="openBar()"> Sara Ahmed (2017)</a>, who in her book Living a Feminist Life only cites women of color. She does this because she sees her book as a contribution to feminist of color scholarship and activism. With this she contributes to the world she calls home. However, our worlds are different, and this thesis is only the first time I officially establish a written position within the graphic design field.

	<h2 class="title" id="Encounter">MY FIRST ENCOUNTER WITH FEMVERTISING <hr></h2>
	<p> As long as I can remember there has always been advertising around me. In the form of tv commercials, that were a lot more present and important to me around Christmas time, to the first banner advertisements on the internet, and in the form of billboards and abri’s on the streets. They were everywhere. Their form has especially changed a lot in the short twenty-five years that I have been consuming them.<br>
	I was born in the mid-90s, the time of the Spice Girls, Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera, Kate Moss, K3 and a whole bunch of other beautiful skinny (white) people in the media. Not really a problem if you are an under ten-year-old white girl.<br><br>
	Growing older, however, things started slowly changing. Being born mid-90s also meant growing up with the internet. By the time puberty hit me, I was already spending 80% of my spare time on the internet: chatting to my friends on msn, building my own websites, and being active on a fashion forum.<br>
	I started to read more blogs discussing the portrayal of women in media and them causing girls and women to feel insecure about themselves. When reading these blog articles at first, I was convinced this idea was stupid. Sure, these women I saw everywhere were extremely beautiful and thin, however I convinced myself that I didn’t wanted to look like them. I saw them in an editorial or artistic way. I didn’t think I was feeling more insecure than any teenage girl would. The boys and girls at my school were causing more of my insecurities than any magazine anyway. So, I brushed these blog articles off as some people complaining on the internet.<br><br>
	Then came the advertisement that changed it all: <em>Dove’s ‘Campaign for Real Beauty’</em>. Especially the <em>‘Evolution’
	</em> (<a href="#figOne" onclick="openAll()"> fig. 1</a>) commercial made a big impact on me. In the video commercial a woman walks on set, poorly lit and with no make-up. Then a time lapse starts in which the woman is completely transformed. Firstly, with better lighting, make-up and hair styling. After this transformation, a picture is taken and selected. This picture is again completely transformed through an image editing software. The video ends with a shot of the final completely edited and transformed image on a billboard, that has two young girls passing it.<br>
	The commercial is part of Dove’s <em>‘Campaign for Real Beauty’
	</em>. Even more than a decade after its first launch, people are still talking about this campaign. —Although over the last ten years the conversation has been less and less positive, but I will get back on that later. —<br><br>
	This advertisement from Dove was different than any advertisement I had ever seen, and I was totally into it. This advertisement was showing something that I already read about, but nobody had ever shown it this clearly. This advertisement was making the same statement about beauty and the portrayal of women in media as those ‘complaining’ blog articles did. This specific commercial, however was starting to change my mind. Maybe these articles had a point, maybe this weird portrayal was damaging for girls’ and women’s self-image. Maybe they were also influencing me much more than I realized before. By making it visual, Dove helped me realize this. It was the first time I came in contact with a form of femvertising. —Of course, when the campaign was launched the word femvertising didn’t exist yet. — Even though it was not the first piece of femvertising; it is referenced as the re-introduction of femvertising into the 21st century.<br><br>
	What is this femvertising and where does it come from? You could explain it by taking the word apart: Femstands for Feminist, and -vertising is for advertising: ‘Feminist Advertising’. According to SHE Media and Adweek femvertising is defined as “advertising that employs pro-female talent, messages and imagery to empower women and girls.” <a href="#Powel"  onclick="openBar()">(Powell, R. 2014)</a> But what does that mean exactly. What is pro-female talent? What are pro-female messages? And what are images that empower women and girls? What does advertising include and what is not advertising? What even is empowering for women or for people in general? These are all questions that popup when reading this vague definition.<br><br>
	Since I saw the Dove <em>‘Evolution’</em> commercial, that I was so impressed by as a young teen, I noticed a pattern. Other brands (with a female target audience) seemed to have seen the success Dove had with their <em>‘Campaign for Real Beauty’</em> and it inspired them to use the same strategy. At the start this change of how advertisements were speaking to women was very not really noticeable and very welcome change. However, the more time past, the more it began to look as if this new approach to advertising and branding towards women, became more the rule than the exception. The more I started noticing this, the more femvertisments were starting to annoy and anger me.

	<h2 class="title">THE FIRST FEMVERTISMENTS<hr></h2>
	<p>
	As stated before, Dove reintroduced femvertising back into the 21st century with this <em>‘Campaign for Real Beauty’</em>. Which means femvertising isn’t an invention of today. Examples of femvertising date back to 1929.<br><br>
	In 1929 Edward Bernays got the assignment to think of a campaign to sell more cigarettes to women. It was, in 1929, very controversial for a woman to smoke and it wasn’t even permitted to do so in public. However, the American Tobacco Company (ATC) felt that they were missing out on 50% of the people they could sell their product to. So, they assigned Edward Bernays to make smoking appealing to women and increase their target audience. Bernays first, unsuccessful, attempt to speak to this new target audience was by promoting cigarettes as a way of weight loss. <em>“Reach for a Lucky instead of a sweet.”</em> (<a href="#figThree" onclick="openAll()">fig. 3</a>) Then on the 31st March in 1929, during the Easter Parade in New York, Bernays hired female participants to smoke their Lucky Strikes as <em>“Torches of Freedom.”</em> (<a href="#figTwo" onclick="openAll()">fig. 2</a>) Whilst encouraging bystanders and participants of the march to <em>“Fight another sex taboo!”</em> by inhaling the smoke of gender equality. Bernays paid these women in the march to smoke the cigarettes, and he informed the press about the event and the tagline <em>“Torches of Freedom”</em>. Just to make sure they would show up and write it all over their newspapers the next day.<br>This ‘PR stunt’ has all the ingredients of a femvertisment: It is an advertisement for cigarettes, and it is ‘employing pro-female messages, and created an image for the empowerment of women and girls. <em>“Torches of Freedom”</em> PR-stunt was a success for Bernays and ATC. Combining this PR-stunt with the “Reach for a Lucky instead of a sweet” campaign, they nudged the percentage of female cigarette buyers up by more than half, from 5 percent in 1923 to 12 percent post-march. (<a href="#Zeisler" onclick="openBar()">Zeisler, A. 2016</a>)<br><br>
	Barnays was aware of his time and because of that a success. During the first world war many women were leaving the home to take over jobs from the men that were sent to the front lines. After the war, these women felt that they deserved more rights, since they had experienced what they were capable of. At the time of the march (certain) white women had recently received the right to vote and the first wave of feminism was still fresh on everyone’s mind. <br><br>Others noticed these successes of Barnays and ATC in their targeting towards women and they especially noticed the results in their sales. And so, companies started to apply similar messages in their campaigns directed at women.<br>An example is Maidenform’s <em>“Dream”</em> campaign from 1949 (till 1969). (<a href="#figFour" onclick="openAll()">fig. 4</a>) The, mainly visual, campaign is showing women in their Maidenfrom bra doing all kind of ‘dream-like’ activities. For example, “climbing the highest mountain” or “going on a tiger hunt”. Others suggested ‘dream-like’ activities as going to work, school and win an election. Because women can, apparently, only dream of things like education, work and winning elections. Looking back, this campaign feels ironic. The campaign was created to empower women to dream about things that should not really be dream-like activities. Going to work, going to school and winning an election. Even sadder is that since, there still hasn’t been a female president in the USA or a female Prime Minister in the Netherlands.<br><br>
	However, I would argue that the Maidenform’s <em>“Dream”</em> campaign would classify as femvertising. Considering when it was created. After the second world war, feminism got a little bit of an image issue. When the men came home from the warfront, all they wanted was to come home to a beautiful wife that would nurture them and their beautiful children.<br> “It was easier, safer, to think about love and sex than about communism, McCarthy, and the uncontrolled bomb” Betty Friedan states in The Feminine Mystique (<a href="#Friedan" onclick="openBar()">1963</a>). Societies perspective on the role of women changed, and so did advertising strategies.<br><br>Women were dropping out of education earlier than ever before to get married and become housewives. They didn’t develop an identity next to the identity of a housewife. Advertising of the time tried to give meaning to this housewife identity, with the newest vacuum cleaners, dishwashers, cooking recipes, etc. “With increasing skill, the ads glorify her ‘role’ as an American housewife — knowing that her very lack of identity in that role will make her fall for whatever they are selling.” (<a href="#Friedan" onclick="openBar()">Friedan, B. 1963 p. 186</a>)<br><br>
	You could call this area the most sexist time in advertising. Feminism was definitely not top of mind, so femvertising wasn’t either. So, when looking at the Maidenform’s “Dream” campaign through the eyes of that time, it was definitely more feminist than other advertisements of the time. Creating new dreams and fantasies for women. Still of course not encouraging them to pursue them for real. Buying the Maidenform bra would give them the same feeling of empowerment, as actually doing the actual thing.

	<h3 id="SecondFem">SECOND WAVE OF FEMVERTISING</h3>
	<hr>
	<p>
	In The Feminine Mystique (<a href="#Friedan" onclick="openBar()">1963</a>), Friedan started to question the position of the woman in the times after the war. When interviewing the women of her time, she noticed that their situation wasn’t ideal at all for woman. “Man finds himself by losing himself; man is defined by his relation to the means of production; the ego, the self, grows through understanding and mastering reality - through work and love.” (<a href="#Friedan" onclick="openBar()">Friedan, B. 1963 p.270</a>) “Women, as well as men, can only find their identity in work that uses their full capacities.” (<a href="#Friedan" onclick="openBar()">Friedan, B. 1963 p. 273</a>) Together with others of her time she stood at the start of the Women’s Liberation Movement (WLM). They were slowly starting to change the perspective of society again. Brenna Fahs (<a href="#Fahs" onclick="openBar()">2020</a>) describes this period as follows: “Feminist manifestos exploded onto the scene from 1967 to 1971, a period marked by rampant sexism, emerging feminist resistance, consciousness-raising, and collective organizing. Building on the momentum of the civil rights movement, the feminist revolts of the late 1960s paved the way for decades of feminist activism that followed.”<br><br>
	As the second wave of feminism rose and the popularity of feminism. Femvertising also reappeared. Virginia Slims, the first cigarette explicitly marketed to young and professional women, even went as far as to celebrate how far women already got. In their print and TV campaign, launched in July 1968, they paid a little homage to the <em>“Torches of Freedom”</em> from Lucky Strike. The campaign carried the slogan “You’ve come a long way, baby” (<a href="#figSix" onclick="openAll()">fig. 6</a>) which suggested that being able to inhale that formerly masculine smoke was liberation itself, rather than a by-product of it. This way Virginia Slims established themselves as a real cigarettes brand for women and by 1980s their market share had grown from 0.24 percent to 3.16 percent. (<a href="#Zeisler" onclick="openBar()">Zeisler, A. 2016</a>) However, this campaign had nothing really to do with feminism. It is merely celebrating women and how great it is to be a (smoking) woman in a time you can buy cigarettes for women.<br><br>
	In the seventies new aspirational archetypes for women were created like Charlie the perfume <em>“for the new woman”</em>. (<a href="#figSeven" onclick="openAll()">fig. 7</a>) This advertisement campaign was launched in 1973 by Revlon. The advertisements feature Shellie Hack walking all over town in beautiful (sparkling) suits, spraying her parfum, meeting people, being adored and accompanied by a jingle that assured potential buyers that this was the fun kind of liberation.<em>“Kinda young, kinda now, Charlie! / Kinda hip, kinda wow, Charlie!”</em> With this campaign advertisers were again careful not to explicitly name feminism and the Women’s Liberation Movement of the time. The idea was to capture potential customers who believed just enough in women’s liberation that they would want to support companies that referenced it. But never go as far as promoting certain movements themselves. <br><br>
	In 1979 Revlon followed Charlie’s success with the launch of Enjoli, which took it a tiny bit further. Where Charlie represented a carefree symbol of the liberated American female, Enjoli actually showed what it took to maintain that freedom with its tagline: <em>“The 8-hour fragrance for the 24-hour woman”.</em> (<a href="#figEight" onclick="openAll()">fig. 8</a>)<br><br>
	A woman that knew what she was doing and who was putting in the hours to make sure everything was carefree and well organized. These aspirational women were only promoting the aspects that most of the public could easily agree with or recognize. Everybody wants to be or be with an independent woman, that can do whatever she pleases, do things her way, go out and about, be welcomed everywhere, maybe even earn her own salary, to spend it on beautiful things like perfume. A woman that makes sure everything goes the way it is supposed to go, because she is fantastic. These Revlon advertisements were celebrating the liberated woman and all she does.

	<h3 id="FemNew">FEMVERTISING'S NEW APPROACH</h3>
	<hr>
	<p>
	In the nineties femvertisments were starting to take a different direction. Sports brand Nike ventured into the world of femvertisment with their successful <em>“If You Let Me Play”</em> campaign. (<a href="#figNine" onclick="openAll()">fig. 9</a>) This campaign was led by a tv commercial in which girls tell you about the studied benefits of young girls playing team sports as a girl-power tagline: <em>“If you let me play sports, I will like myself more, I will have more self-confidence. … I will be 60% less likely to get breast cancer, I will suffer less depression. … I will be more likely to leave a man that beats me. I will be less likely to get pregnant before I want to. I will learn wat it means to be strong. If you let me play sports.”</em><br><br>
	This was one of Nike’s most successful campaigns ever. It served to align the brand with feminism, education, and progressivism and it was doing this without compromising. (<a href="#Zeisler" onclick="openBar()"> Zeisler, A. 2016</a>) “It wasn’t advertising. It was truth.” said Janet Champ, who served as Nike’s chief copywriter during the campaign. Here I want to note that even that this might be true; it being the truth about young girls playing sports, it is still advertising. It is beneficial for Nike if more girls play sport. If girls start playing sports, they need clothing and equipment to do so, which Nike is happy to supply. By 1997, the company’s female positive focused advertising was rewarded with 43 percent of the athletic-footwear market. With this campaign from Nike it seemed that the focus of femvertisments shifted from celebrating the liberated woman to liberating the girls.<br><br>
	From Nike’s successful femvertising campaign in the nineties the timeline brings us back to the, for me, perspective changing <em>“Campaign for Real Beauty”</em> by Dove. Entire essays are written on this campaign and the impact it had on society and the perspective of the brand. The campaign started in North America and the UK with advertisements that showed women of all ages, colors and sizes. Next to the portraits of these women were checkboxes with questions like <em>“half empty, half full?”, “withered, wonderful?”</em> and <em>“grey, gorgeous?”</em> Some of them, like the <em>“grey, gorgeous?”</em> had a line that said “Why can’t more women feel glad to be grey? Join the beauty debate.” All of them had a website URL to their campaign website. More than 1.5 million women were inspired or curious enough to visit Dove’s website on the strength of the <em>“Tick Box”</em> campaign. (<a href="#figTen" onclick="openAll()">fig. 10</a>) (<a href="#Zeisler" onclick="openBar()">Zeisler, A. 2016</a>)<br><br>
	However this was only phase one of Dove’s campaign. In phase two, all over major cities (mainly in the US) huge billboards started popping up with images of ‘real’ women. The images for the campaign were shot by famous female photographers Annie Leibovitz and Peggy Sirota, together with a 2004 study commissioned by Dove and developed in part by Harvard University’s Nancy Etcoff and the London School of Economics’ Susie Orbach.1
